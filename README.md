# HCS-Fall_2020

Spring 2021 Notes

If the database needs updating use scaffolding to update the models (Do NOT update them manually this can have issues in the future, scaffolding keeps naming consistant)


Both Views and Pages are used to create pages so check both folders when looking for a page to edit


In case the master branch is having problems Johns branch will have a working version too
